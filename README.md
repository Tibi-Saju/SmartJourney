A PHP project created for Kerala State Road  Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to manage  transport functionalities in a digital approach.

This project was created for KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Cooperation) buses, named as “Intelligent Business Analysis and Planning Software for Transport Department” .The front end of this project is PHP and backend is MYSQL. 

The main aims of this project are 
1. The administrator can easily analyse the total trip details, he can find which trip is better, which one is loss. The analysing module helps the administrator to make a trip better. 
2. To reduce the work of conductor and for security and keep the record of every passenger in the bus.

This project provides a new face to the KSRTC. A card is created for every passenger with a QR code. The card contains the details of passenger with photo. The card is rechargeable one. It can be recharged in KSRTC bus stands, or using online. When the passenger enter the bus the conductor scan the QR code and enter the destination, then the amount for the journey is reduced from the card.

Passenger in the bus stop can identify the upcoming buses available seats etc. In every stop the system automatically updates the availability of the seats. If the first bus is crowded one they can understand the  time to the next buses.

The application was developed with scalability in mind. The system is highly flexible and is well efficient to make easy interactions with the clients. The speed and accuracy are maintained in a proper way. The data entered in a specified format without any data loss hence providing security.
